# .io Real-Time Strategy Game

A way to bring RTS back into the lime-light.

In order for RTS to work as a .io game, two requirements must be met:

1. The game must be easily playable on all platforms (especially mobile)

2. The game must be much more simple than traditional RTS games, but still include gameplay features that are vital to any good RTS game.

## Playability

Making sure the game can be enjoyed easily on all platforms.

### Controls

The controls that are common on PC RTS games must also be easily used on a mobile device. The various actions in a typical Real-Time Strategy include

- selecting units

- deselecting units

- selecting groups of units

- selecting enemy units to attack

- zooming the camera in and out

- scrolling the window

How these actions are performed on a computer is well documented, but this is not the case on mobile or touch devices. However, the actions can be performed adequetely on a touch device:

- Select a unit: tap on that unit

- Deselect unit: tap on that unit again

- Select a group of units: touch and drag on screen

- Select enemy unit to attack: tap on that unit

- Zooming camera in and out: pinching the screen

- Scrolling the window: touch and drag on screen with two fingers (or maybe just use joystick/directional pad (maybe provide both options for users))

### UI

The interface of the game must be simple and easy-to-read on all devices, including those with small screens. Common UI features of RTS games include

- Top-down view of the battlefield

- Minimap

- Pause menu

- Mini-menu for building structures, units, etc.

- Mini-menu or display for currency(s)

- Unit behavioural commands (defend, attack move, patrol, etc.)

For the sake of simplicity, and due to the constraints of smaller screens, many of these features will not be easily doable (or doable at all). However, for the IO game we can include:

- Top down, 2D view of the battlefield

- Minimap for PC, but maybe not for mobile devices

- An all-in-one mini-menu that will display selected units or structure, buildable stuctures/units, and currency.

- Behavioural commands may not be possible, but we could include a 'hold fire' button for selected units for example.

## SRS

* The game will include only two controls: lateral movement via a joystick, and game control via tapping/clicking.

* The game shall be a top-down, 2-dimensional game.

* The game shall begin with a single unit that, when deployed, determines the location of a persons base.

* The game shall have various buildings that unlock and produce different units.

* The game shall have defensive buildings.

* The game shall have a team-based game mode, or in it's place a diplomacy system.

* The game shall have a chat system.

* The game shall handle base building and movement via a grid system.

* Multi-unit selection shall be done via tapping/clicking and dragging (paired with the screen movement, if need be).

* The game shall have a construction bar where buildings and units are displayed.

* The game shall have a single form of currency.
