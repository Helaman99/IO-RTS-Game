# IO RTS Game

I love web development and RTS games, so why not combine the two? I've never really done much with game development, other than
random tinkering on Unity, Roblox, etc. so this will be my first real attempt at building a game.

## How to launch
1. Clone repository
2. Navigate to `IO-RTS-Game/io-rts-game`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run with `npm start`
